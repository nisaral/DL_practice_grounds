Furthermore, the kernel contains a meticulous *exploration and cleaning* of the data, *time series analysis* of the electricity price and careful *feature engineering*. With further research and development (e.g. as a forecasting model which is updated in real-time) a similar approach could possibly prove useful to all the stakeholders (electric power companies, investors, etc.) involved in energy markets. For the time being, I believe that this kernel can serve as a **future reference** for aspiring data scientists, as it contains an *end-to-end time series forecasting project* and demonstrates the -minimum- level of immersion that a dataset needs in order to turn into something which is actually applicable in the real world.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n\n- [<font size=\"5\">1.
